This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)){
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")

}
library("DESeq2")
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
count_matrix<-as.matrix(read.csv("/Users/matanatmammadli/Desktop/df_sc.csv",row.names = "gene"))
#head(count_matrix,5)
count_matrix<-count_matrix[,-7]
head(count_matrix,5)
length(count_matrix)
count_matrix<-count_matrix[which(rowSums(count_matrix)>100),]
length(count_matrix)
coldata <- data.frame(
   sample = c( "ctr1", "ctr2", "ctr3", "trt1", "trt2", "trt3" ),
   condition = c( "control", "control",  "control", "infected", "infected", "infected" ), 
  row.names = "sample" )
coldata$condition <- as.factor(coldata$condition)
coldata
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_matrix, colData = coldata, design = ~ condition)
dds <-DESeq(dds)
v<- vst(dds,blind = FALSE)
v
plotPCA(v,intgroup="condition")
plotDispEsts(dds)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
